# DiffScraper

DiffScraper is a distributed and synchronized tool that can be used in price comparison studies.  Offers are extracted from websites, mobile applications, mobile browsers and other outlets simultanously.  For the full description, see my master thesis.

For those interested to install DiffScraper themselves, DiffScraper is composed of two sub-projects:
- DiffScraper Controller
- DiffScraper Bot
