# DiffScraper

DiffScraper is a distributed and synchronized tool that can be used in price comparison studies.  Offers are extracted from websites, mobile applications, mobile browsers and other outlets simultanously. The project has been created under the supervision of [Hugo Joncker](http://www.open.ou.nl/hjo/) and [Benjamin Krumnow](https://blogs.gm.fh-koeln.de/ktds/en/team-en/benjamin-krumnow/)
